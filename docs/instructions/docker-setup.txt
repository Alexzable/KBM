Docker Setup and Verification on Windows 10
===========================================

1. Check if Docker is already installed
---------------------------------------

Open CMD or PowerShell and run:

    docker --version

If you see something like:
    Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfcd85
→ Docker is already installed.

If you get:
    'docker' is not recognized as an internal or external command
→ Docker is not installed or not added to PATH.

2. Download Docker Desktop
--------------------------

Go to the official Docker website:
    https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

For most machines (Intel or AMD CPU), download the version for:
    Windows (AMD64)

Only download the ARM64 version if you are on an ARM-based device (like Surface Pro X).

3. Install Docker Desktop
-------------------------

- Run the installer (`Docker Desktop Installer.exe`)
- Select:
      ☑ Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V
- Complete installation
- Reboot your PC if prompted

4. Start Docker Desktop
-----------------------

- Open the Start Menu → Search for `Docker Desktop` → Launch it
- Wait until you see the message:
      "Docker is running"

Note: Docker Desktop must be running in the background for Docker CLI to work.

5. Test Docker CLI
------------------

Open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

    docker run hello-world

Expected output:
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    ...

If you get a connection error like:
    open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified
→ Make sure Docker Desktop is running.

Optional: Run CMD as Administrator if needed.

6. Enable auto-start for Docker Desktop
---------------------------------------

Inside Docker Desktop:
- Go to Settings (⚙️) → General
- Enable:
      ☑ Start Docker Desktop when you log in

7. Useful Docker Commands
-------------------------

List all containers (running + exited):
    docker ps -a

List all downloaded images:
    docker images

Start an interactive Ubuntu container:
    docker run -it ubuntu bash

8. Common Issues
----------------

- Docker command not found:
    → Docker not installed or not in PATH

- Docker daemon connection error:
    → Docker Desktop is not running

- Permission denied:
    → Try running terminal as Administrator
